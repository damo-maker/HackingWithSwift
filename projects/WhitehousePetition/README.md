# Project 7: WhitehousePetition
This project is missing segue code in the MasterViewController.swift file. The DetailViewController.swift file does not load the parsed SwiftyJSON.swift file's petition data. The 'modal' transition also hides the back button on the Details page's Navigation Bar.  The code is Swift 3 and the build done in Xcode 8.2.1.
